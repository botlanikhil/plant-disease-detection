🌱 Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture


📌 Project Overview:


This project aims to build a Deep Learning-based Plant Disease Detection System that helps farmers and agricultural experts identify plant diseases quickly and accurately. By leveraging computer vision and deep learning models, the system analyzes images of plant leaves to classify and detect diseases, enabling timely intervention for sustainable agriculture practices.



🔍 Problem Statement:


Plant diseases can significantly impact crop yields, leading to financial losses and food shortages. Manual identification is often time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. Automating the detection process using Deep Learning can provide:

Accurate disease identification
Faster diagnosis using image inputs
Sustainable agricultural practices by reducing chemical overuse


🎯 Objectives:


Design a robust deep learning model to classify and detect plant diseases from leaf images.
Deploy the model for real-world use (mobile/web interface).
Improve agricultural sustainability through early disease detection.


🛠️ Features:


Multi-class Classification: Classifies images of leaves into healthy or diseased categories.


Image Input Support: Users can upload images for real-time predictions.


User-Friendly Interface: Deployable on web or mobile platforms.


Interpretability: Visualizes results for end-users.


🔧 Tools & Technologies:


Language: Python


Frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch


Libraries:
OpenCV (Image Processing)
